Weather and Crime in Toronto: Analyzing the Impact of Meteorological Conditions
on Criminal Activity

This study aims to understand the influence of weather on crime rates in Toronto
using Random Forests and XGBoost Models. By combining two datasets; one with
crime data and one with meteorological data, this study looks at what weather
conditions looked like when crimes were and weren't committed. By using 
a Random Forest model and an XGBoost model, information on how
impactful various weather factors are on crime rates was extracted. Read the full
